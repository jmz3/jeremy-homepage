I'm excited to announce that our project [SAMM](https://github.com/bingogome/samm) has received many attentions from all over the world! Please reach out if you want to collaborate. SAMM allows users to directly leverage the powerful Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment medical images (including CT, MR, Ultrasound, and more) in 3D Slicer.
