## Learning-based 2D/3D Fluoroscopic Image Registration
We developed and maintained an open-source python package [xregi](https://github.com/jeremyzz830/xregi/tree/master) that is used to compute the projection matrix between 2D x-ray images and 3D CT scans. This process is also called as 2D/3D fluoroscopic image registration problem. The package is now available on Pypi. Install the pacakge through `pip install xregi` to try out!
