## PoseHub: Surgical Tool Tracking with AR Headset
We are developing a surgical tool tracking system that can be used with augmented reality headsets. The system is designed to provide real-time feedback to the surgeon about the location of the surgical tool. The system has a scene-graph structure that allows for easy integration with different tracking devices and visualization tools. A synthetic dataset is generated in ROS to test the system. The code is available [here](https://github.com/jmz3/PoseHub.git)
