Hello! My name is Jiaming (Jeremy) Zhang. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Sciecne at [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My reasearch focuses on the application of robotics in medical scenarios. Prior joining in Hopkins, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I graduated with honors. Afterwards, I obtained my Master's degree in Robotics at Hopkins. I was an intern engineer at Narwal Robotics and HUST-Wuxi Research Institute. During my leisure time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking and reading. 


# Research Interests and Experiences
As a robotics enthusiast, I have conducted research in various areas. My research spreads out in medical image processing, surgical robotics, stereo vision, object detection and tracking. I also had a diverse experience in neurosciences, especially in vestibular and auditory systems.

Currently, I'm working as a research assisant in [BIOMECHANICAL AND IMAGE GUIDED SURGICAL SYSTEMS (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/) laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Mehran Armand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0jQj6m4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Amir Kheradmand](), and [Prof. Alejandro Martin-Gomez](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/alejandro-martin-gomez/).
