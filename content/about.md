# Bio

Hello! My name is Jiaming (Jeremy) Zhang. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Sciecne at [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). Prior joining in Hopkins, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I graduated with honors. Afterwards, I obtained my Master's degree in Robotics at Hopkins. I was an intern engineer at Narwal Robotics and HUST-Wuxi Research Institute. During my leisure time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking and reading. 


# Research Interest and Experience
As a robotics enthusiast with a strong interest in visual perception, motion planning, and medical robots, I have conducted research in various areas such as hand-eye calibration, LiDAR-based SLAM, exoskeleton design and analysis, AI-based medical image analysis, and medical robots. Thess experiences equip me with solid foundation for Mathematics, ROS development, Robot Hardware Design and the state-of-the-art Computer Vision models.

# Ongoing Project

Currently, I'm working as a research assisant in [BIOMECHANICAL AND IMAGE GUIDED SURGICAL SYSTEMS (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/) laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Mehran Armand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0jQj6m4AAAAJ&hl=en). Here are the projects that I'm carrying out.

- [Deformable Object Simulation](#deformable-object-simulation)
- [Robot TMS](#robot-tms)
- [Position-based Visual Servoing](#position-based-visual-servoing)
- [Learning-based 2D/3D Fluoroscopic Image Registration](#learning-based-2d/3d-fluoroscopic-image-registration)
- [3D Slicer Integration with Segment Anything Model, aka SAMM (Segment Any Medical Model)](#samm)

## Deformable Object Simulation

## Robot TMS

## Position-based Visual Servoing

## Learning-based 2D/3D Fluoroscopic Image Registration
We developed and maintained an open-source python package [xregi](https://github.com/jeremyzz830/xregi/tree/master) that is used to compute the projection matrix between 2D x-ray images and 3D CT scans. This process is also called as 2D/3D fluoroscopic image registration problem. The package is now available on Pypi. Install the pacakge through `pip install xregi` to try out!

## SAMM
I'm excited to announce that our project [SAMM](https://github.com/bingogome/samm) has received many attentions from all over the world! Please reach out if you want to collaborate. Here is a demo video of SAMM.
