# Bio

Hello! My name is Jiaming Zhang, you can call me <b>Jeremy</b>. I am a second year master's student in Robotics at [The Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). Prior joining in Hopkins, I received my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/), where I graduated with honors. I was an intern engineer at Narwal Robotics and HUST-Wuxi Research Institute. During my leisure time, I enjoy playing tennis, cooking and reading. 


# Research Interest and Experience
As a robotics enthusiast with a strong interest in visual perception, motion planning, and medical robots, I have conducted research in various areas such as hand-eye calibration, LiDAR-based SLAM, exoskeleton design and analysis, AI-based medical image analysis, and medical robots. Thess experiences equip me with solid foundation for Mathematics, ROS development, Robot Hardware Design and the state-of-the-art Computer Vision models.

# Ongoing Project

Currently, I'm working as a research assisant in [BIOMECHANICAL AND IMAGE GUIDED SURGICAL SYSTEMS (BIGSS)](https://bigss.lcsr.jhu.edu/) laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Mehran Armand](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0jQj6m4AAAAJ&hl=en). Here are the projects that I'm carrying out.

- Deformable Object Simulation
- Robot TMS
- Position-based Visual Servoing
- Learning-based 2D/3D Fluoroscopic Image Registration
- 3D Slicer Integration with Segment Anything Model, aka SAMM (Segment Any Medical Model)

I'm excited to announce that our project [SAMM](https://github.com/bingogome/samm) has received many attentions from all over the world! Please reach out if you want to collaborate.
